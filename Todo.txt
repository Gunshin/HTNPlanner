domain.pddl parsing finished. precondition and effect have not been finished however as they have not been set to evaluate yet. need to take each node
and compare it to predicates and primitives. biggest problem will likely be foreach.


problem.pddl:
	currently adding the object list to intial states relation list, not sure if this is the smart thing to do. will this object list change during
	plan generation?
	

Task Manager:
	Change Int type to Float
	Support single precondition array with and/or
