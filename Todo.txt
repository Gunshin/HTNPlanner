- rate of change heuristic currently just takes the lowest level, largest value for any goal_node

- rate of change heuristic - adding actions to the manager are not being shared eg. one planner action could be pushed into multiple fresh copies
of the manager thing.


- need to look at action costs for integer parameters
	eg.
	
	integer parameters
	
	timber 4
	build cart 0
	build cart 1
	load cart 0 timber 1
	load cart 1 timber 1
	move cart 0 location 1
	move cart 1 location 1
	unload
	unload

	action cost to planner: 9
	actual action cost: 12

	normal
	
	timber
	timber
	timber
	build cart 0
	load cart 0 timber 1
	move cart 0 location 1
	unload
	move cart 0 location 0
	load cart 0 timber 1
	move cart 0 location 1
	unload

	actual cost: 11
	
	


- Need to do function testing on domains so that i can set input parameters and states, and an expected outcome to see if it is correct.

- relaxed plan generation and extraction
	- after done once, check to see if the plan is viable due to various numeric issues
	- if issues have been found, add the issues to the goal tree? temporary goal tree?
	- a temporary goal tree could be satisfied at some point in the plan, without being needed
		to be satisfied at the end
		
		
- metrics are not taken into account at all with heuristic or planner
- path cost is also not taken into account

0 < ~count < 30
50 < ~count < 70

must evaluate any nodes contained within this node, which do not include our target value eg. '~count'

must add support for multiple value evaluation eg:
	(== (~count) (* 2 (~arc)))
	(< (~count) (~arc))

should i seperate the evaluation to allow me to verify whether the non value preconditions are allowed first? ----------------------------------------------

should i make the sets global and not per function? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Needs to be a distinction between 'or' and 'and'
	- and must return an array containing an range from a lower bound to an upper bound and/or a series of equivalence functions
	
	- or must concat all arrays from children. It does not form ranges of values, or look at equivalence functions. only concat.

and:
	- returns an array of values
		- could be a range from min to max if children are greater/less thans
		- could be values coming from an 'or' or multiple equivalent nodes
		eg.:
			(and
				(> (~count) 0)
				(< (~count) (+ (20) (10)))
			)
			gives:
				[1, ..., 29]
		eg.
			(or
				(and
					(< (has ?item) 20) ;; <<<< must be evaluated first
					(== (~count) 10)
				)
				(and
					(> (has ?item) 20)
					(== (~count) 50)
				)
				(and
					(> (~count) 0)
					(< (~count) 5)
				)
			)
			gives: has ?item == 10
				[10, 1, ..., 4]
			gives: has ?item == 25
				[50, 1, ..., 4]


or:
	- concats any arrays passed back up by its children, and returns it
		(or
			(== (~count) (* 2 (inventory_count)))
			(and
				(<= (~count) 10)
				(> (~count) 0)
			)
			(and
				(> (~count) 50)
				(< (~count) 60)
			)
		)
		gives:
			[~count = 2 * ~arc, 1, ..., 10, 51, ..., 59]
