SCREWED UP. NEED TO COPY SOME THINGS FROM REWORK BRANCH TO MASTER BRANCH IMMEDIATLY.






currently writing taskmanager evaluation function. need to write some form of parameter thing so that,
if the taskmanager is evaluating a func, it can find the correct paramters. a map should do. need to finish
this so i can finish the Tree evaluate function.





Task Manager:
	Change Int type to Floa
	Support single precondition array with and/or
	
When evaluating do auto search for functions first instead of having to define func infront
